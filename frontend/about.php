        <p>The insurance work surged in January 2005, when the River Tyne burst its bank causing flooding to many homes in Corbridge. To accommodate the expansion the partnership moved into a small industrial unit in Cramlington. Demands of the business saw the introduction of Donna Spark to manage the administration and finance.</p>

          <span class="date">2008 - 2012</span>
        </div>
        <p>The town of Morpeth flooded twice within four years, firstly in 2008 and again in 2012. Substantial damage to both domestic and commercial properties generated work once again.</p>
<br>
        <p>The most recent flooding occurred in June 2012, after a freak thunderstorm in Newcastle. Properties flooded throughout the region, proving to be the most destructible flooding event we have seen. Company turnover tripled as a result of this one incident.</p>
