    <h3 class="title">About Henderson Building Contractors</h3>
    

    <br>
    <div class="about">
    <p>Henderson Building Contractors was formed in 1984 by Bill and Ros Henderson. Operating out of their family home, they carried out private domestic work to the local area.
        
        <br>
        <br>

In 1994, the partnership expanded and entered into the insurance industry working with structural surveyors and loss adjusters. At this time Paul Henderson joined the business to work with and gain experience from his father.
        <br>
        <br>

The insurance work surged in January 2005, when the River Tyne burst its bank causing flooding to many homes in Corbridge. To accommodate the expansion the partnership moved into a small industrial unit in Cramlington. Demands of the business saw the introduction of Donna Spark (nee Henderson), to manage the administration and finance.

        <br>

In 2008, the business was incorporated and become Henderson Building Contractors Limited. The original partners invited son and daughter to join as company directors to drive the business forward. The Limited company moved into the current premises at 14 Atley Business Park, Cramlington.
The town of Morpeth flooded twice within four years, firstly in 2008 and again in 2012. Substantial damage to both domestic and commercial properties generated work once again.

        <br>
        <br>
        
The most recent flooding occurred in June 2012, after a freak thunderstorm in Newcastle. Properties flooded throughout the region, proving to be the most destructible flooding event we have seen. Company turnover tripled as a result of this one incident.
<br>
        <br>
On completion of the 2012 flood work, Bill and Ros Henderson retired from the business. After 29 years of service, they confidently handed over the company to Paul Henderson and Donna Spark.
<br>
        <br>
Thanks to a dedicated and committed workforce and management team, the business continues to be a great success. The company is excited and looking forward to further growth in the years to come.
